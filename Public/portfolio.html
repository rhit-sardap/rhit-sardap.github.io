                    <img src="images/Base Plot.png" alt="screenshot of base plot">
                    <p>I am currently working on developing a novel biosensor for early cancer detection using photonic
                        crystals. My area of research is to utilize deep learning and artifical intelligence to find the
                        most viable design structure. The image above is a plot generated from our base case values.
                        From here, I will be adapting it to fit more complex structures.</p>

                    <p>Blooming Bookworms is a nonprofit dedicated to giving books to children in low-income
                        communities. My siblings and I started this nonprofit a few years ago in hopes of increasing
                        literacy rates in low-income areas in St.Louis. As head of Research and Development, I studied
                        the effect of books on young students' minds and created resources for both these students and
                        potential donors on the importance of book ownership. I will be starting a branch in Terre Haute
                        Indiana in the next year.</p>

                    <h2>Joust Recreation</h2>
                    <p>I worked to develop a recreation of the popular game Joust using Java and JavaSwing graphics.
                        This project consisted of pair programming and debugging. This follows object-oriented
                        principles.</p>

                    <h2>Anti-Road-Rage</h2>
                    <p>Created Anti-Road Rage, a spin off of the game Road Rush using pygame. As part of a group of 2, I
                        pair programmed 6 out of 8 classes and developed special features of the game.</p>
