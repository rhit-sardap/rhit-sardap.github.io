    <p>Hello! I am Preksha Sarda, a sophomore commputer science student minoring in Artificial Intelligence at
      Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am incredibly interested in the applications of computer science in the
      medical field, and hope to one day improve healthcare across the country. I have spent a lot of time volunteering
      and shadowing at rural clinics and hospitals in Iowa. Through this
      experience, I have spoke with patients, physicians, and nurses about their struggles with the healthcare system.
      These issues are multifaceted, ranging from limited available technology to insurance coverage to software.</p>
    <p>I have enjoyed studying computer science and working with my peers and professors on a variety of projects. I am
      currently seeking an internship or a research position for the summer of 2024. </p>
